Discord bot for regular utilities. Currently using it to scrape details for course resgistration.

**Instructions**
I would suggest using a virtual environment to install required packages using pip

```
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
```

creating virtual env:

```
python3 -m venv env
```

activate using:

```
#for mac:
source env/bin/activate
#for windows:
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

install the required packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

to deactivate virtual environment after you're done:

```
deactivate
```
